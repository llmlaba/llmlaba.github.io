# Due to a serious vulnerability we now require to upgrade torch to v2.6
**Original error message**  
Due to a serious vulnerability issue in torch.load, even with weights_only=True, we now require users to upgrade torch to at least v2.6 in order to use the function. This version restriction does not apply when loading files with safetensors. See the vulnerability report here https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32434

## What we can do?

This is a very nice code exception! We definitely should upgrade **PyTorch** to **2.6 +**. But if my GPU not support by PyTorch higher than 2.5 what we can do?

1. Downgrade transformers to version "transformers<4.48"
2. Convert pytorch binary weights from `.bin` to `.safetensors`
